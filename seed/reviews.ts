    content: "To be honest, there's very little new in this formulaic action adventure. It's the usual old who has got the launch codes mystery that sees Sly Stallone's \"Barney\" recruit his best mate \"Christmas\" (Jason Statham) and their lethal gang of expendables to thwart the ambitions of an unknown criminal mastermind who is hoping to arm a boat load of nuclear missiles and start WWIII. Thing is, tragedy strikes very early on in the film and \"Christmas\" is taken off the team that is sent to avenge that. Is he staying home to fester? Of course not, and lucky too - for soon he is trying to free his pals from captivity before all hell breaks loose. Plenty of pyrotechnics, a bit of contrived sexual chemistry (with Megan Fox's \"Gina\") and loads of bullets and missiles flying around keep the film moving along well enough, but the story is the thinnest of the thin; the baddie's identity is hardly a challenge to discover nor is the twist in the tale at the end remotely unexpected. Good to see that the acting colossus that is Dolph Lundgren is still getting on screen nowadays, but otherwise this really is unremarkable stuff that even the usually charismatic Statham can't really sustain.",

    content: "MORE SPOILER-FREE MINI-REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/mini-reviews-2023-edition\r\n\r\n\"Fast X surprisingly pulls me back into a saga I had practically given up on. Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly the first film in a final trilogy. Interpret this last sentence as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

    content: "Anyone remember the little tune that went with the Edward Woodward television series? Well you won't hear it here in this rather procedural vehicle for Denzel Washington. His usually meticulous planning is compromised by a young lad with a rifle. This leaves \"McCall\" needing the care of a doctor \"Enzo\" (Remo Girone) in a small Sicilian town that is about to become the centre of the venal ambitions of \"Vincent\" (Andrea Scarduzio) and his henchman younger brother \"Marco\" (Andrea Dodero) who uses his team of thugs to extort from the local businesses. It's only a matter of time before heads clash and, well - you can guess the rest of this actually rather brutally predictable drama. Dakota Fanning appears now and again in a rather unnecessary sub-plot involving the CIA and some Syrian narcotics smugglers that is really undercooked - but for the most part this is really just Denzel being, well, Denzel on his quest to save his new-found friends from the grip of the unscrupulous Camorra. It's overlong for what it is, and I found Washington's performance to be rather sluggish throughout before a denouement that came across as rather simplistically rushed. It's fine, but forgettable.",

    content: "**OPPENHEIMER IS \"NOT FOR EVERYONE\" AS STATED BY CHRISTROPHER NOLAN BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE FILM HIMSELF. ** But those who have ample knowledge of physics and chemistry, this film is a masterpiece. The film takes the viewer into the mind of the \"Father of the atomic bomb\" how he thinks, how he feels with much accuracy. Nolan beautifully explains his life both on a private and professional front. The music, the sounds with each scene are top notch. The visuals of QUANTUM PHYSICS, FISSION, NUCLEAR EXPLOSION are mind-boggling. \r\n\r\nIf possible, watch it in IMAX. \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE IS FULL OF DIALOGUES, CONVERSATIONS MOVING BACK AND FORTH IN TIMELINE. It's a historical biography with fantabulous acting by C.M., E.B., R.D.J. and more. The scenes with ALBERT EINSTEIN are just wow. A plethora of scientists(BOHR, FERMI, TELLER, HEISENBERG) of the age can be seen throughout.  There are no action scenes if you are in search of that. \r\n\r\nIT IS A CINEMATOGRAPHIC BRILLIANCE. IF U CAN'T WATCH SIENTIFIC HISTORY JUST DON'T GO.",
